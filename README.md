Search for and download a specific format with youtube-dl

This script displays a YouTube video's available formats and asks the user to choose a format to download.</br>
The user's most recent item on the xclip clipboard is used as input for the video download commands.

Dependencies:</br>
youtube-dl</br>
xclip

My reasons for uploading this script:</br>
I'd be happy to receive help. I'm new to scripting. This is a script I wrote and have recently been working on because I personally use it often. I often have to download videos or audio for work or personal use. I have very limited bandwidth, which makes downloading preferable to streaming, and it also makes format selection essential.

TO-DO:</br>
Replace xclip clipboard with a clipboard that retains more than one entry, and</br>
write code to search that clipboard for the most recent YouTube URL.
